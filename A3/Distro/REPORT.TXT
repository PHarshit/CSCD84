Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 mark) Explain your reward function. What game elements
      are used, and why you think this is a good reward function
      for this problem.



2 .- These are multiple experiments (once you are sure your
     QLearning code is working!)

     * IMPORTANT! * For each training run, SAVE the Qtable
     you will re-use the Qtables later.

     (1 mark) # Experiment 1, 10000 training trials, 20 rounds, random seed 1522,
     # 8x8 grid, cat-smartness .9

     Initial mouse winning rate (first rate obtained when training starts): 6.0484%

     Train your mouse, and once trained, run the evaluation and
     record the mouse winning rate: 83.8225%

     (1 mark) # Experiment 2, 1000000 training trials, 50 rounds, random seed 1522,
     # 8x8 grid, cat-smartness .9

     Initial mouse winning rate (first rate obtained when training starts): 6.4436%

     Train your mouse, and once trained, run the evaluation and
     record the mouse winning rate: 90.4653%

     (1 mark) Would the mouse keep improving and become invincible if
     you ran, say, 100,000,000 training rounds per batch?

4 .- Using the QTable saved from Experiment 2 (NO re-training!)

     (1 mark) # Experiment 3 - Run the evaluation on the 8x8 grid, cat-smartness=.9,
     # but using the random seed 4289 for the game.

     Mouse Winning Rate: 33.3408%

     (2 mark) # Experiment 4 - Run the evaluation on the 8x8 grid, cat-smartness=.9,
     # but using the random seed 31415 for the game.

     Mouse Winning Rate: 47.4143%

     Average rate for Experiement 3 and Experiment 4: Average of Experiment 3 = 33.3165%, Average of Experiment 4 = 47.1141%

     (1 mark) Compare with the rate obtained in experiment 2. What is happening here?
	   A: The rate is a lot lower for Experiment 3 and Experiment 4, since the environment isn't static from Experiment 2, the one on which the mouse was actually trained.
	   In other words, since the environment layout changes the mouse doesn't know how to perform on it, and thus performs poorly.

5 .- Understanding the effects of state space on learning ability:

     (1 mark) # Experiment 5 - Train your mouse on the 16x16 grid, using random seed
     # 1522, 1000000 trials, and 50 training rounds. Cat-smartness=.9

     Initial mouse winning rate (first rate obtained when training starts): 3.0010%

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 63.1559%

     (1 mark) Compare the final winning rate with that from Experiment 2, what can
     you say about the difference in winning rates?
     A: The winning rate is a lot lower for Experiment 5 compered to Experiment 2; this is because
     the state space is a lot larger for a 16x16 grid, compared to an 8x8 grid. The mouse needs
     to be trained a lot longer to achieve a winning rate similar to the one seen on the 8x8 grid.

6 .- (2 marks) Is standard Q-Learning a reasonable strategy for environments
     that change constantly? discuss based on the above

7 .- (3 marks) Explain your feature set for feature-based Q Learning, and
               explain why and how each feature is expected to contribute
	       to helping your mouse win

8 .- Carry out the following experiments:

     (1 mark) # Experiment 6: Train your mouse using feature-based Q-Learning, on
     # the 16x16 grid, one cat, and one cheese, cat-smartness=.9,
     # random seed = 1522, and use 1000000 trials and 50 rounds.

     Initial mouse winning rate (first rate obtained when training starts): 3.2204%

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 76.5528%

     Compare this rate against the rate obtained in Experiment #5, what
     are your conclusions regarding the utility of feature-based
     Q-Learning?

     (1 mark) # Experiment 7, using the saved weights from Experiment 6 (no
     # re-training) run the evaluation using random seed 4289, same
     # 1 cheese, 1 cat, and cat-smartness=.9, 16x16 grid

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 76.1977%

     (1 mark) # Experiment 8, using the saved weights from Experiment 6 (no
     # re-training) run the evaluation using random seed 31415, same
     # 1 cheese, 1 cat, and cat-smartness=.9, 16x16 grid

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 76.7146%

     (1 mark) Comparing the winning rates from Experiments #7 and #8 against
     those from Experiment #6, what can you conclude about feature-
     based Q-Learning in terms of its ability to deal with changes
     to the environment?

9 .- Carry out the following experiments:

     (1 mark) # Experiment 9: Train your mouse using feature-based Q-Learning, on
     # the 16x16 grid, 2 cats, and 3 cheeses, cat-smartness=.9,
     # random seed = 1522, and use 1000000 trials and 50 rounds.

     Initial mouse winning rate (first rate obtained when training starts): 8.6726%

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 79.9304%

     (1 mark) # Experiment 9: Using the trained weights from Experiment 9, (no
     # re-training), run the evaluation on the 16x16 grid, 2 cats,
     # 3 cheeses, cat-smartness=.9, and random seed 4289

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 78.7606%

     (1 mark) # Experiment 9: Using the trained weights from Experiment 9, (no
     # re-training), run the evaluation on the 32x32 grid, 2 cats,
     # 3 cheeses, cat-smartness=.9, and random seed 4289

     Mouse Winning Rate (from evaluation after training): 73.5841%

     (2 marks) Based on the last 3 experiments, what can you conclude regarding
     the usefulness and applicability of standard Q-Learning vs.
     feature-based Q-learning?

10 . - (2 marks) We obviously can not train an expensive robot by trial and error,
      How would you implement feature-based Q-learning for a mobile bot so you
      can take advantage of reinforcement learning but not spend millions on
      broken robots that keep falling down the stairs?
